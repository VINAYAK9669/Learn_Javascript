-----Basic of "Infinity" and "-Infinity" concept

            > In JavaScript, "Infinity" is a special numeric value that represents infinity.
            > It is used to indicate numbers that are too large to be represented within the numerical limits of the JavaScript number data type
        Some KEY POINTS
            > Positive Infinity:
                                > Positive Infinity is represented by the value "Infinity" in JavaScript. 
                                > It is used to denote a number that exceeds the maximum representable value.
            > Negative Infinity:
                                > Negative Infinity, represented by "-Infinity" in JavaScript.
                                >used to denote a number that is extremely negative, beyond the minimum representable value.
            > Mathematical Operations:
                                  When certain mathematical operations result in a value that exceeds the numeric limits, 
                                  JavaScript returns Infinity

            It's important to note that Infinity is a special value in JavaScript and is not a regular numeric value. 
            It is primarily used to handle scenarios involving extremely large or small numbers or to indicate a 
            mathematical concept of infinity within JavaScript calculations.
