1. What is the scope of the varible or function?

    ans: Scope of variable is the life-time or availability of a variable


2. What is hoisting in Javascript?

    ans: It is the behaviour of Javascript where all the decalration will moved to the top of the current scope (current script/current function).
    This Means that we can use  variable or function before it has been declared.

    Note: The variable declared with var are only get hoisted, as using let and const will not support hoisting 

3. How does block scope works?

    It is nothing but the brackets{}, an if condition, for loop, do while loop etc, which creates a seprate scope for decalration existing in that block. This can be acheived when we declare the variable with 'let' keyword.
