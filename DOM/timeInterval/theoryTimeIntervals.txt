Question:
   Which are the time based Intervals in JavaScript, explain them in brief.

Answer: There are 4 time based events 
        1) setInterval()
           This function repeatedly calls a specified function or executes a code block with a 
           fixed time delay between each call. It continues until clearInterval() is called 
           or the window is closed.

           SYNTAX: 
           setInterval(function, milliseconds, param1, param2, ...);

        2) clearInterval()
           * This method is used to stop the execution of the function that was set to run at a 
             specific interval using setInterval().
           * It takes the interval ID  

           SYNTAX: 
           clearInterval(intervalID);

        3) setTimeout()

           * SYNTAX: 
             setTimeout(function, milliseconds, param1, param2, ...);

           * This method executes the specified function after a given delay (in milliseconds) 
             and only runs once.

        4) clearTimeout()

          * clearTimeout(timeoutID);

          * This method is used to cancel the execution of a function that was set to run 
             after a certain delay using setTimeout().
         *  It takes the timeout ID returned by setTimeout() as an argument.
