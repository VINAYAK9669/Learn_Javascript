In this we will understand what are the 
 1) Event Bubbling
 2) Event Capturing
 3) Event Propagation

 Note: 

 * Event bubbling and event capturing are two different mechanisms for handling events 
   that occur on DOM elements. 
 * Event propagation refers to the process of how events are propagated through the DOM tree. 

 1) Events Bubbling

    * It is the default behaviour in JS when event is triggered on an element nested inside the other element.
    * When an event occurs on target element, it will trigger the event handlers of the target element
      itselt then to its parent element until reaches the root element.

            Event Propagation:  Bottom to Top

2) Event Capturing:

   * Event capturing, also known as event trickling or event propagation in the capturing phase, 
     is the opposite of event bubbling.
  *  This is not the default behavior in modern browsers and is not widely used.

           Event Propagation:  TOP to Bottom


3) Event Propagation:

    Event propagation refers to the way events are passed and triggered through the DOM tree, either through 
    event bubbling or event capturing.

    Event propagation can be controlled using the addEventListener method's third argument, 
    which specifies the event's propagation type: true for capturing phase, false (default) for bubbling phase, 
    or an object with {capture: true} or {capture: false}.
