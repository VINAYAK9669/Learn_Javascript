Answer 1) 

      window: Represents the browser window and acts as the global scope for JavaScript code.
      document: Represents the current HTML document loaded in the browser and allows manipulation 
                of its content using the DOM.
        
      ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WINDOW: 

      * It provides various properties and methods related to the browser window, 
        such as alert(), setTimeout(), setInterval(), etc.

      * Window also contains information about the current URL, location, history, and more.

Answer 2) 

      DOM 
            is a programming interface for web documents, representing the HTML or XML document 
            as a tree-like structure. 

      DOM API

            provides methods to interact with and manipulate the document using JavaScript or other 
            scripting languages.

            Some of the Scripting languages that work with DOM are, 
             1) JavaScript
             2) Python
             3) PHP
             4) Ruby
             5) Java
             6) Perl
      It's important to note that while some languages like JavaScript have native support for DOM manipulation, 
      others require external libraries to achieve similar functionality.
             

Answer 3 & 4)
      * BOM stands for Browser Object Model. 
      * It is a programming interface provided by web browsers that allows developers to interact with and 
        manipulate the browser window and its components, such as the document, frames, history, location, and navigator.
      * With the BOM, developers can perform actions like modifying the URL, opening new browser windows, 
        accessing browser history, and handling events related to browser actions.
      * While the DOM handles the structure and content of the webpage, the BOM deals with browser-specific 
        functionality and interaction.
      * BOM can vary slightly between different web browsers, as each browser implements its own version 
        of the BOM. But,  DOM is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), 
      * DOM represents the hierarchical structure, wherein BOM does not have a strict hierarchy like the DOM.

Answer 5) 
      In the browser, the global object is called "window." 

                                                Window
                                                  ↓
                        -----------------------------------------------------------------
                        DOM                                                           JavaScript
                        ↓                               ↓                               ↓
                        document                     BOM                        JavaScript Functionalities
                        ↓                            ↓
                        <html>                       Screen
            ↓                    ↓                   Location
            <head>              <body>               Navigator
            ↓                  ↓                     Frames
            <title>           <a>    <h1>            Histroy
                                                     XML HttpRequest
