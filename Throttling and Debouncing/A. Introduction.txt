# INTRODUCTION TO DEBOUNCE AND THROTTLE
    - Debounce and throttling are the two techniques used to control the frequency of certain 
      events.
    - These techniques are used where events occur rapidly or frequently.

1)  THROTTLING
    -  This is the technique where the function calls occur after fixed interval regardless of how 
       frequently the triggering event occurs.
    - It can be used to prevent excessive resources usage or to enforce a certain rate limit for API calls.

  Here's how throttling Works:
    - When the event is triggered it will call the function immediately.
    - However, subsequent event triggers within a specific time interval are ignored.
    - After the time interval elapses,  the function becomes eligible for execution again.

  BEST EXAMPLE: "SCROLLING A WEBPAGE"- You can set interval for scrolling event for better experience.


2)   DEBOUNCE 
    - In this technique  we set the interval at which the repeated function calls can execute on event trigger.
    - If another event triggers within the specified interval then the timer is reset.
    - The function is executed only when the timer completes without being reset.

Here's how debounce Works:
    When the event is triggered, a timer is started.
    If the event is triggered again before the timer elapses, the timer is reset.
    If no new event is triggered within the timer's duration, the function is executed.
    This prevents the function from being executed until there's a pause in the events.

Best Example: When implementing search suggestions, you might want to wait for the user to pause typing before sennding
              a request to fetch suggestions.
