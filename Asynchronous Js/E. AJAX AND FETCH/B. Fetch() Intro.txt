        Question 1) What is fetch in JS?

                    - Fetch is the built in function that allows us to make network requests
                      to retrieve resources, typically data, from a specified URL.
                    - Commonly used to perform HTTP requests and interact with APIs.
                    
                    Basic Syntax:

                            fectch(url, options)
                            {
                            .then(response=>
                                {
                                
                                })
                            }.catch(error=>
                                {
                                
                                })
                
                Here, 
                      url: This is the URL of the sources you want to fetch. it might be relative/absoulte URL
                      options: 
                                - This is a optional parameter that allows you to specify various options for the 
                                  request , such as headers, requests method (GET, POST), request body and more.
                                - It's an object that you can customize according to your needs.
                                - 
            
            - fetch function will returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing 
              the response to the request.
            - .then() method is used to handle the response when it's successful and the .catch()
              method is used to handle any errors that occur during the requests.

NOTE:   The fetch API by default makes a GET request. In case if you want to make a POST request then the optoinal object parameter can be used.
