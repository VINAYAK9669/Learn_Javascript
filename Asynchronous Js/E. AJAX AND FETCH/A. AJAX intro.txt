Question 1) What is AJAX in JavaScript ?

            - AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
            - It is the technique in web development that allows you to fetch and display data from a server
              without refreshing the entire page, leading to more interactive and responsive web applications.

        NOTE: It's worth noting that while the name "XML" is in AJAX, modern web applications often use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
              instead of XML for data interchange due to its lighter weight and better compatibility with JavaScript.
