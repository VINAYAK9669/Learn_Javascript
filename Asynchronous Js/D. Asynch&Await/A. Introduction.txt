******************* INTRODUCTION TO ASYNCH AND AWAIT ******************

    * Question-1: What are async and await in Javascript?

            - These are the two keywords introduced to work with asychronous code.
            - Using these we can write a asychronous code in more managable and redable way.
            - Async and Await commonly used when dealing with function that return promises.


    * Question-2: What are async and await in Javascript?
   
            - Async keyword used to define a function as asynchronous.
            - When we mark a function as "async", it means that the function will always return a promise.
            - So, because of this the execution of the function will be paused until the promise is resolved or rejected.
    
    * Question-3: Provide the syntax of async function?
    
            async function fetchData()
            {
              * // Asynchronous operations
                   return somePromise;
            }

    * Question-4: What is await keyword in JS?
   
            - This keyword used inside the asynch function to pause its execution until a promise is resolved.
            - It can only be used within an async function.
            - When you use await before a promise, it will wait for that promise to be resolved and then return the 
              resolved value.

    * Question-5: What is the syntax of await keyword/how to use it       
   
            Here how we can use await with asynch function
            
                async function someFunction()
                {
                const result =await somePromse;
                return result;
                }
