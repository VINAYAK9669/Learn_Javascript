Question 1] What is asynchronous programming in Javascript?

Answer:   * This is the way of code execution, allowing tasks to run independantly. 
          * To run one part of the program it will not block other part of the programs.
          * Instead of blocking the entire program while waiting for other tasks to finish, aysnchrounous programming 
            enables other tasks to continue running, enhancing, overall effieciency and responsiveness.
Examples: Exmples for the Asynchrnous programming are 
            1) Fething data from a server
            2) Waiting for user interaction
            3) Reading/writing files


Question 2] The techniques/ the ways by which we can achieve Asynchronous programming

Answer:  1)  Callbacks
         2)  Promises
         3)  Async/Await
