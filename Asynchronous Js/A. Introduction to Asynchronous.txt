Question 1] What is asynchronous programming in Javascript?

Answer:   * This is the way of code execution, allowing tasks to run independantly. 
          * To run one part of the program it will not block other part of the programs.
          * Instead of blocking the entire program while waiting for other tasks to finish, aysnchrounous programming 
            enables other tasks to continue running, enhancing, overall effieciency and responsiveness.
Examples: Exmples for the Asynchrnous programming are 
            1) Fething data from a server
            2) Waiting for user interaction
            3) Reading/writing files


Question 2] The techniques/ the ways by which we can achieve Asynchronous programming

Answer:  1)  Callbacks
         2)  Promises
         3)  Async/Await


Question 3]  When callback functions are used?

Answer: When we want to run a piece of code inresponse to a certain event or at certain point of time then we use callback functions


Question 4] Explain the scenarios where callback functions are used?

Answer:           i) Asynchronous Operations
                 ii) Event Handling
                iii) Timers and Intervals
                 iv) Callbacks in APIs
                  v) Promises and Asynchronous Patterns   
                 vi) Higher-Order Functions

Question 5] What is the meaning of the callback hell or pyramid of DOOM?

Answer:           * It Is the situation in asynchronous programming where mutliple layers of nested callbacks or function
                  calls are use to handle asynchrnous operations

                  * This can result in code that becomes difficult to read, maintain and debug due to its deeply nested 
                    and convoluted structure.
